## Lessons & Difficulties

Reading HTML is difficult. I decided to use comments to separate sections
and make parsing all the tags easier.

## Diary

My bookmarks bar has become too messy. It is no longer useful. It's time
to clean up, gather better resources, practice development skill, and
work on a personal project.
