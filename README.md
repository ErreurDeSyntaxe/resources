## Lessons & Difficulties

Reading HTML is difficult. I decided to use comments to separate sections
and make parsing all the tags easier.

Defining and planning projects deliberately and thouroughly helps.

## Diary

- My bookmarks bar has become too messy. It is no longer useful. It's time
  to clean up, gather better resources, practice development skill, and
  work on a personal project.

- After building the Omnifood website, I appreciate more the value of defining the project and planning its components more deliberately. This personal project also needs such an approach.
